"""Linear sum assignment — hand-written Hungarian / Jonker-Volgenant (decision 016).

Layer-neutral, like `schemas.py`: L1 uses it inside Murty's k-best joint
association, and the evaluation harness uses it to match tracks to ground truth.
Neither owns it.

Written rather than pulled from scipy, deliberately. This project is numpy +
pydantic and nothing else, and adding ~40 MB of scipy for one function is a poor
trade when the function is 60 lines and is exactly the kind of algorithm the
project exists to be able to defend from memory.

THE ALGORITHM (shortest augmenting path with potentials, O(n^3)):

The assignment problem is a min-cost perfect matching on a bipartite graph. The
naive view — try every permutation — is O(n!). The Hungarian insight is that the
optimum is unchanged if you subtract a constant from any row or column, so you
can maintain "potentials" u[i], v[j] with the invariant

    reduced_cost(i, j) = cost[i][j] - u[i] - v[j] >= 0                (*)

and grow the matching only along edges where the reduced cost is ZERO. By
complementary slackness, a perfect matching using only zero-reduced-cost edges
is optimal for the ORIGINAL costs. Each of the n outer iterations adds one row
to the matching by finding a shortest augmenting path in the reduced graph
(Dijkstra-like, hence the `minv` distance array), then shifting potentials by
the path length `delta` so that at least one new edge becomes tight — which is
what keeps invariant (*) while making progress.

This is the standard "e-maxx" formulation: 1-indexed internally with a virtual
row 0 as the path sentinel, which is why the arrays are sized n+1 / m+1.
