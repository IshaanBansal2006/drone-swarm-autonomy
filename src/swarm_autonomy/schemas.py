"""Cross-layer message schemas (decision 040 — approved 2026-07-30).

Pydantic models are the source of truth; the wire codec is model_dump_json /
model_validate_json (interim transport: JSON in std_msgs/String; upgradeable to
generated .msg/IDL without touching these definitions). No layer owns this
module — L1 produces TrackMsg, L2 consumes intents and produces assignments and
proposals, L3/L4 read everything.

DS mass functions (dict[frozenset[str], float]) are JSON-unfriendly; they cross
the wire with each focal set encoded as a sorted "|"-joined string
("person|vehicle"). encode_mass/decode_mass are the only codec for that.

Uncertainty crosses the wire as a Cholesky FACTOR, not a covariance (040
amendment, 2026-07-30). See TrackMsg.position_sqrt_cov.
