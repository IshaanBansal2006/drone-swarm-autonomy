"""CBBA task allocation (decision 021 — Choi, Brunet & How 2009).

Two alternating phases per round:
  1. BUNDLE BUILD (greedy, per drone): repeatedly add the task with the best
     *marginal* score improvement at its best path-insertion point, but only if
     that score would OUTBID the task's current global winner.
  2. CONSENSUS: drones exchange (bids, winners); for each task the highest bid
     wins (ties -> lower drone_id). A drone that loses a task drops it AND every
     task it added later (bundle truncation — later additions were scored
     assuming the lost task was in the path, so their bids are stale).

Rounds repeat until nothing changes. Scores are time-discounted rewards
S = lambda^tau * reward (tau = arrival time along the drone's path), which are
diminishing-marginal-gain — the property CBBA's convergence guarantee needs —
when tasks are APPENDED. With best-position insertion (what phase 1 does) a
task already in the path can be a paid-for detour into a neighbour's area
and RAISE that neighbour's marginal gain; tests/test_learned_score.py pins a
minority of random cases doing exactly that. The guarantee was therefore
never strict here; the round cap is what ends the auction (decision 024).

Documented simplification (backlog): fully-connected synchronous communication,
so consensus is a global max per task each round. The full Choi conflict-
resolution table (36 rules with timestamps) is only needed for multi-hop /
asynchronous networks — it slots in behind the same interface when comms get
realistic. Convergence bound: <= N_tasks rounds under full connectivity.
