"""Multi-sensor multi-target tracker — wires filter (014) + PDA (011) + lifecycle.

Rewritten 2026-07-29: consumes the id-keyed sensor dict (D-B1), gates with the
REAL innovation covariance from the filter's unscented measurement prediction
(closing old gap #1), and initiates tracks by two-point differencing of radar
detections (closing old gap #2 — the tracker can now bootstrap from empty).

Per-cycle flow (call step() once per UKFConfig.dt of sim time):
    predict all tracks
    for each sensor with detections:  gate -> PDA betas -> combined innovation
                                      -> pseudo-measurement filter update
    birth: unassociated radar detections paired across consecutive cycles
    lifecycle: hits/misses -> confirm (age >= confirm_hits) / delete (max_misses)

Documented simplifications (see docs/backlog.md):
  - PDA, not joint JPDA: exact until gates overlap (multi-target milestone).
  - Pseudo-measurement update (z_pred + combined innovation) omits PDA's
    covariance-inflation "spread of innovations" term — optimistic in clutter.
  - Camera poses are per-step inputs (`camera_models`): the platform moves, so
    extrinsics cannot live in config. Fixed radar/lidar poses come from config.
    A value may be a bare CameraModel (pose taken as exact — the legacy
    harness) or a MountedCamera (decision 019): the platform's ESTIMATED pose
    plus its covariance, handled by the Schmidt-Kalman consider update so the
    pose error widens the innovation and is remembered across cycles via the
    track's consider_xc block instead of being re-counted as fresh noise.
  - Classification (decisions 012/015/D-B7): per cycle, each sensor's BEST
    associated class-carrying detection contributes a mass function; the cycle's
    masses fuse via conflict-weighted discounting, then Dempster-combine into
    the track's running DS-native belief (temporal fusion of prior with new
    evidence uses plain Dempster + the K-guard; discounting the prior too is a
    noted alternative).
