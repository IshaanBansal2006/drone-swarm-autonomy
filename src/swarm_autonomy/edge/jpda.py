"""Probabilistic data association (decision 011, joint layer per 016).

Ref: Bar-Shalom & Li, "Multitarget-Multisensor Tracking", Ch. 3.

Two association modes share one output convention, so the tracker's downstream
code (combined innovation -> pseudo-measurement update) is identical for both:

  - `compute_association_probabilities`  — PDA. Each track normalises its own
    hypotheses in isolation. EXACT for a single target, and for multi-target
    scenes whose gates never overlap.
  - `compute_joint_association_probabilities` — JPDA. Enumerates FEASIBLE JOINT
    events across all tracks (no detection claimed twice, no track claiming
    two), then marginalises each track's betas out of the joint distribution.

The difference only bites when gates overlap. Independent PDA lets two tracks
each take most of the same detection — physically impossible, since one
detection came from one object — and the result is both filters converging on
the same target, one track starving, and identities swapping when the targets
separate. That is an ID switch, and it is the failure the joint layer exists to
prevent.

Enumeration here is EXHAUSTIVE: exact, but the feasible-event count grows
combinatorially. It is the reference implementation and the exactness oracle a
k-best (Murty) solver is tested against; `max_events` bounds the blow-up and the
overflow is reported, never silently truncated.
