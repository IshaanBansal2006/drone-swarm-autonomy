"""Filter factory — constructs the estimator selected by config (decision 014).

`UKFConfig.covariance_form` picks the strategy; consumers call `make_filter`
and `initial_state` instead of naming a filter class, so swapping strategies
(or re-running the D-B2 bake-off) never touches call sites. UKF and
SquareRootUKF share the same predict/update signatures; only the state carrier
differs (P vs its Cholesky factor), which `initial_state` hides.
